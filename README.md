# AOE3wpfg
Age3 DE UI in SC2 layout

## How to

* Clone project
* Use ResourceManager (0.5.0) to extract all bars inside Age3/Game/UI and put the output into
aoe3wpfg/resources.
* Build the solution
* Open xaml in designer view

## Troubleshooting

* Designer says "BitmapImage initialization is not complete. Call the EndInit method to complete
the initialization."  
-> Files in /resources are missing.
